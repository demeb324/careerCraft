        <h2 class="important" id="about">About My Topic</h2>
        <p>Many students feel lost in their career journeys, unsure of whether they‚Äôre on the right path or where to even begin. 
            This uncertainty often stems from a lack of guidance, accessible resources, or exposure to opportunities that align with their interests and skills. 
            Navigating career options can be overwhelming, particularly for students who may not have mentors or clear examples to follow.
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is to bridge this gap by providing a centralized platform tailored to students' career aspirations. This platform will offer resources like mentorship connections, career assessment tools, and curated paths that guide students through decision-making, skill development, and job opportunities. Whether someone is exploring potential careers, seeking internships, or aiming to switch paths, this initiative will serve as a compass to help them craft their unique career journey with confidence.</p>

                        With programs opening and closing rapidly and various applications to do, students are discouraged from applying.
